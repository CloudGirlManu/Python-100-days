# **Day 03 Control flows and logical operators**

## Learning summary

###
1. Conditional statements

    - if/else statements: allows you to execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition is True or False.
    - nested if/else statements: when you place one if statement inside another.
    - if/elif/else statements: allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially. If the first condition is False, python moves to the next elif and so on.
    - multiple if statements: allows all if statemennts to be checked independently.

2. Logical operators

    - Logical operators are used to evaluate boolean expressions and return True or False.
        - and : returns True if both conditions are true
        - or : returns true if at least one condition is true
        - not : reverses the boolean value

3. Modulo operator

    - The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation.

4. Code blocks and scope
