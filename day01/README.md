# **Day 01 Working with variables in Python to manipulate data**

## Learning summary

###
1. Print function

    - The print function allows you to print a string into the console.

2. Commenting

    - Use the # symbol to add comments in your code. Anything after this symbol is ignored by the computer.

3. Debugging

    - Tip: If you encounter an error, try searching for it on Google to find possible solutions.

4. String Manipulation

   - A string is just a sequence of characters. It should be surrounded by double quotes.
   - String concatenation merges 2 separate strings (print("Manu" + "ela") will print Manuela)

5. Variables

    - Variables act like a "box". It stores the value of that variable, wheter it is defined by the user or it is defined as an environment variable.
    - To define a variable we can't use spaces or start with a number, but we can USE_UNDERSCORE or capitalLettersButNotOnTheFirstLetter.

6. Input function
    - Prints a string into the console and asks the user for a string input.

7. len() function

    - Returns the number of items in an object.
